This directory contains example-scripts that are packaged with the rpm. They are
intented to give the user a start-point for running the DAQ. The user should
copy them to his own directory, alter them, and run them.

ports 5000 are used for external clients and gui to connect to the FR1
ports 5002 / 5001 are used for internal communications between the FR1 and FP1
port 5004 is used for external clients to connect to the FP1

for FR2/FP2, add 10 to these port numbers.

FR1 receives pixel-data on 196.254.1.8:8000, 8001
FR2 receives pixel-data on 196.254.1.9:8000, 8001

max_buffer_mem is the number of bytes for the data-buffer between FR and FP.
8Mb is one frame, and 10 frames is acceptable. If your disc can jam or be slow,
you can increase this to provide a larger space for queueing pixel-data.
The shared memory buffer is shown in /dev/shm.

in fpN.json it is important to set "master" : "data", as this tells the
frameProcessor the last dataset it will get is "data" and so it knows when
to close a file.
